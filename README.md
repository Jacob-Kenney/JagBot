<h2 align = "center"> Description </h2>
<p> JagBot is a trading bot built entirely with python. It includes functionality for a vast range of features including; general market indicators, live stock market orders executed through an API, machine learning sentiment analysis, data visualisation, and ofcourse an algorithm which uses a combination of the listed features in order to make informed, profitable market trades.

JagBot was initially created for the purpose of learning, although we will continue to improve and adapt the program in order to, not only improve our programming skills, but also to make a product that provides a steady return on investment.<p>

<h3 align = "center"> Future </h3>
<p> the project is fundamentally complete although there is huge opportunity for improvement available, in the future we would like to:
  
    -Better follow market indicators in order to buy and sell at better times.
  
    -Incorporate the machine learning sentiment anaylsis to make well informed trading decisions.
  
    -Generally improve code.<p>

<h1 align="center"> JagBot </h1> 
<h2 align = "center"> Description </h2>
<p> JagBot is a trading bot built entirely using python. It includes functionality for; general market indicators, live stock market orders executed through an API, machine learning sentiment analysis, data visualisation, and ofcourse an algorithm which uses a combination of the listed features in order to make informed, profitable market trades.

JagBot was initially seen as a project with the sole intention as learning, although we will continue to improve and adapt the program in order to, not only improve our programming skills, but also to make a product that provides a steady return on investment for free.<p>

<h3 align = "center"> Future </h3>
<p> the project is fundamentally complete although there is huge opportunity for improvement available, in the future we would like to:
  
  -Better follow market indicators in order to buy and sell at better times.
  
  -Incorporate the machine learning sentiment anaylsis to make well informed trading decisions.
  
  -Generally improve code.<p>
